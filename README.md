# Cycle Consistent Variational Autoencoder
This repository is an implementation of the paper 'Disentangling Factors of Variation with Cycle-Consistent Variational Auto-Encoders' (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10469.pdf).

The 2D Sprites dataset was provided by Scott Reed in his work 'Deep Visual Analogy Making'.
